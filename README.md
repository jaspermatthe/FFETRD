# FFETRD
**Forest Fire Extinguishing and Tree Replanting Drone. Pygame.**

Pygame inspired by the increasing amount of forest fires around the world in recent years.

This game was developped by Jasper Matth√© for his first year BSc Aerospace Engineering program Python Course at TU Delft in the Netherlands.

The following tutorial was used to learn how to use classes in pygame: http://codingwithruss.com/pygame/breakout/text.html

As such, one may notice many similarities between the structure of the "grid" class and that of the "wall" class in the above tutorial
